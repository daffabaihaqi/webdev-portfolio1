<h1>The Best Animes According to Daffa</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>This is the best anime that I ever watched, it has more than 1000 episodes but it was worth it!</p>

<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>The story starts off simple, but gets more complicated later on. This anime is filled with plot twists</p>

<h3>Blue Lock</h3>
<p>Sport Anime where the characters are encouraged to have an ego. Pretty unusual for this genre</p>
